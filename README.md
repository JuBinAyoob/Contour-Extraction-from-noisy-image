# Contour-Extraction-from-noisy-image

-Simple Image Processing Project


module 1: Convert noisy colour image to binary image
          colour image -> greyscale image -> binary image
          
module 2: point extraction
          extract the pixels positions of object image(colour of object image is white), and save it in a two dimensional Array...

module 3: Geometric Graph Construction 
          with above points
          with threshold value root(2)
          
module 4: Point Linking of the contour of object image
          Choosing the edges which have By highest turnaround angle
          
module 5: Contour Simplification
          Removing Unwanted Points...(points that formed due to noise in image)
