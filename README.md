# Contour-Extraction-from-noisy-image

-Simple Image Processing Project


module 1: Convert noisy colour image to binary image
          <br>colour image -> greyscale image -> binary image
          
module 2: point extraction
          <br>extract the pixels positions of object image(colour of object image is white), and save it in a two dimensional Array...

module 3: Geometr<br>ic Graph Construction 
 &nbsp         <br>with above points
          <br>with threshold value root(2)
          
module 4: Point Linking of the contour of object image
          <br>Choosing the edges which have By highest turnaround angle
          
module 5: Contour Simplification
          <br>Removing Unwanted Points...(points that formed due to noise in image)
